  
## Weeks 1–2: Literature Review Foundation

### **Week 1: Getting Oriented**

* Create a comprehensive list of initial sources:

  * Start with adviser recommendations.
  * Add articles from top journals in your field.
* Set up a **note-taking system**:

  * Use a template that includes: Article Title, Year, Journal, Research Question, Motivation, Methods, Findings, and “Impressions.”
* Begin wide reading to orient toward a topic:

  * Read broadly (e.g., books, review articles, generalist journals).
  * Identify areas that excite you.
* Begin populating your reading queue:

  * Use strategies like:

    * Reviewing references from known articles.
    * Checking "Cited By" links in Google Scholar.
    * Searching for "review" + keywords.
    * Doing keyword searches with Boolean logic.
* Begin your **thesis journal** for daily progress and reflections.

### **Week 2: Strategic Reading Begins**

* Start skimming 2 articles per day and completing detailed notes.
* Prioritize identifying:

  * The *research question* and *motivation*.
  * Methods and key findings.
  * Weaknesses, gaps, or assumptions (Impressions).
* Begin identifying 2–3 major **theoretical frameworks** relevant to your topic.
* Organize sources by theme/topic (not chronologically).
* Meet with your adviser to:

  * Discuss promising directions.
  * Get feedback on initial takeaways and reading strategy.

## Weeks 3–4: Refining the Research Question

### **Week 3: Synthesizing and Drafting**

* Continue skimming 2 articles per day.
* Begin creating your **literature synopsis**:

  * Extract and compile each article’s research question, method, and impressions into a separate doc.
* Identify commonalities across Impressions to begin surfacing literature gaps.
* Draft 2–3 potential research questions that could fill those gaps.
* Practice your 3-sentence "elevator pitch" for the project.
* Focus reading on exemplary studies and related methods.

### **Week 4: Finalizing Focus**

* Finalize a specific research question with adviser feedback.
* Clarify if it's empirical, theoretical, or both.
* Identify:

  * Key concepts and variables (especially if quantitative).
  * What makes this question sociologically significant.
* Start roughing out a one-paragraph **research gap statement**, using weaknesses across multiple articles.

## Weeks 5–6: Methodology Design

### **Week 5: Selecting Methods**

* Choose a primary research method.
* From literature:

  * Identify validated instruments or methodological blueprints.
  * Collect examples of similar studies and note their sampling, procedures, and data collection.
* Draft the outline of your **Methods section**, organized by:

  * Sampling
  * Procedure
  * Instruments
  * Analysis approach

### **Week 6: First Draft of Research Materials**

* Draft your survey, interview guide, or observation plan.
* Use figures from literature to draft hypothetical results and design backwards:

  * What data would you need?
  * What kind of figures/tables would support your research question?
* Calculate sample size and feasibility constraints.
* Meet with your adviser for input on proposed methods.

## Weeks 7–8: Testing and Refinement

### **Week 7: Pilot and Revise**

* Pilot your instrument(s) with 3–5 participants.
* Refine based on clarity, usefulness, and time burden.
* Finalize sampling criteria and recruitment methods.
* Begin preparing IRB materials:

  * Consent forms
  * Recruitment scripts
  * Risk/benefit assessment

### **Week 8: Proposal Drafting Begins**

* Conduct a second round of pilot testing if needed.
* Finalize instruments and consent materials.
* Start writing research proposal sections:

  * **Introduction** (based on your synthesized literature review)
  * **Methods**
  * **Timeline**

## Weeks 9–10: IRB and Proposal Draft

### **Week 9: Submission Prep**

* Complete CITI training (or equivalent ethics certification).
* Prepare and compile all IRB documents.
* Finish a **working draft** of the research proposal:

  * Clear research question and gap.
  * Synthesized literature review.
  * Methods section with justifications.
* Get feedback from your adviser on IRB documents.

### **Week 10: Full Proposal**

* Submit your IRB application.
* Complete a full draft of your research proposal.
* Include:

  * Research question and rationale
  * Background/literature review
  * Methods
  * Feasibility and timeline
* Send to your adviser or committee for feedback.

---

## Weeks 11–12: Finalization

### **Week 11: Revisions**

* Revise proposal based on feedback.
* Finalize literature review section:

  * Thematically organized.
  * Clearly identifies and justifies your research gap.
* Double-check that methods are consistent with literature.
* Ensure citations are properly formatted.

### **Week 12: Submission**

* Submit final proposal to department/adviser.
* Check on IRB status.
* Plan for spring semester:

  * Recruitment timeline
  * Equipment/materials setup
  * Additional readings for remaining literature gaps

## Ongoing Weekly Tasks

* Skim and note **2 articles per day** during deep work time.
* Review and update **literature synopsis** weekly.
* Clean up reading queue and remove irrelevant items.
* Add exemplary articles to a separate file for future reference.
* Maintain a thesis journal (20–30 min/day).
* Weekly adviser or peer check-ins.
* Back up your work.
