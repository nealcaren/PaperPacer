[Review the Literature]{.scrivener15}

 

Nothing drops your stomach quite like your supervisor telling you to redo months of unusable work. It brought me to tears. Well, I didn't actually cry. I only cry in movies where washed-up, old men receive some unexpected recognition to redeem their years of mundane struggle---when Arthur is honored by the Screenwriter's Guild in "The Holiday," for example. But there was little redemption in my supervisor's assessment of my poorly planned work that day.

My experiment-motivated outlook landed me in that situation. I left industry for grad school so I could nerd out analyzing energy systems. To me, research meant programming, data analysis, computational models---the sort of intriguing technical work that lures most of us to grad school in the first place. So when my supervisor suggested that I start my first research project by reviewing the literature, I obviously ignored the advice.

"Why do a bunch of reading when I can just discover everything first-hand?" I wondered. "Can't I just tinker around in the lab until I hit on something groundbreaking?" In my great wisdom, I tried that alternative instead. I learned to write an optimization program that modeled the electric grid. It was exciting---I relished engrossing myself in new technical skills. As a bonus, it's satisfying to work on a dark screen full of green-colored programming scripts; I'm really just manipulating spreadsheets, but I know that bystanders suspect I'm editing The Matrix.

A couple of months of this aimless, experiment-motivated research produced some results: findings that I called groundbreaking but my supervisor called unusable. Apparently, my analysis assumptions didn't quite hold, I used a dubious modeling method, and my research question had mostly been answered by other scientists. In short, the computational model was indefensible and the findings were unpublishable.

"How do I fix this?" I wondered. My supervisor reminded me to review the literature. Apparently, it would save me some heartache. How exactly, I wasn't sure. Another thing I was unsure about: how to actually complete a literature review.

The problem with literature review, like each phase of the research process, is that we understand it too vaguely. We underestimate its value and we lack a strategy for completing it. Literature review is just reading, right? Except that it's a nuanced, unstructured, monotonous kind of reading. Without motivation to do it or strategy to make it easier, we'll ignore our supervisor's advice and marginalize this valuable phase of the research process.

In this chapter, we'll develop a motivation and strategy for literature review. Using that strategy, we'll summarize individual journal articles as well as compile our notes across multiple publications to synthesize broader themes. At the end, we'll have a neat stack of reading notes and an organized literature synopsis. Those notes will sharpen our research question, justify our experimental methods, and jumpstart our writing and we'll use them to outline our project in the next chapter. An above-average literature review provides a strong foundation for each of the subsequent research phases to build on. So let's do it right the first time. It's worth the effort.

 

[The Goal of Literature Review]{.scrivener26}

In the literature review phase, we search the academic literature---the library of published journal articles---to give our project context and develop its research gap. Thus, literature review connects strongly with the motivations in Chapter 1. It pursues interdependence by putting our project in the context of other researchers' work.[]{#part0010.html_fn24}[[24]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn24) And by developing a research gap to inform our research question, it creates an end goal for our project. In fact, literature review is an incredibly useful way to begin our project; it jumpstarts our work in many ways.

Unfortunately, we may get a different impression when reading the average journal article. Many publications' literature reviews read as afterthoughts. In these articles, somewhere toward the end of the Introduction, we find a laundry list of citations and "et al.'s" that scattershot around the project's focus.[]{#part0010.html_fn25}[[25]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn25) I suspect---because I know from experience---that such authors do their literature review between finishing their experiment and writing their first draft. Under that practice, literature review isn't a valuable exercise, it's a necessary evil to getting the work published.

We, however, will approach literature review with better motivations---not the feel-good, tweed-jacket, academic motivations that hold dear the literature's intrinsic value and impress on novice researchers how regular reading connects us to broader science and magically primes our brain for innovation---no, I mean more practical motivations. I'm asking what's in it for us?

For one, literature review makes our writing easier. We cite the literature in our journal article for five reasons:

-   1.[ to motivate our work and explain its social value,]{.scrivener30}
-   2\. [to provide technical background information,]{.scrivener30}
-   3.[ to compare our findings against other articles',]{.scrivener30}
-   4.[ to communicate our project's scientific novelty by framing the research gap, and]{.scrivener30}
-   5.[ to justify our experimental methods.]{.scrivener30}

Each of these reasons ease the writing process by giving our manuscript some starting material; a successful literature review will write half of our manuscript for us.

Beyond easing the writing process, those last two reasons---framing the research gap and justifying our methods---ease the experimenting process as well. Gathering our methods from the literature helps us avoid costly mistakes in our experiment. Journal articles overflow with rigorously documented research methods. We should use them. In fact, the more we read, and the more we understand our field's various experimentation techniques, we can simply choose existing, validated methods for running our experiment.

Literature review also underpins a vital guidepost for our experiment---the research question. As we read, we find gaps in scientific understanding. These gaps represent missing knowledge, and we identify them by posing questions that the literature cannot answer. These inquiries evolve into our project's research question. And by building our research question around these gaps and answering it via existing experimental methods, we feel confident that our project can likely solve that research question, produce scientific novelty, and intrigue the researchers in our field. Put another way, literature review protects us from pursuing directionless experiments in search of ambiguous ideas that will either lead nowhere or lead somewhere that nobody cares about.[]{#part0010.html_fn26}[[26]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn26)

So from a practical standpoint, literature review reduces our overall effort. It makes the writing process easier, reduces research mistakes, and helps us pursue a meaningful research question.

But we only receive these benefits if we review the literature methodically. The literature is vast. The days when one could read everything published in their discipline are long gone. Even the savants---those philosophers who unwind each night with a glass of wine and the latest edition of their field's specialist journal---know that we cannot simply wander blissfully through and absorb enough knowledge to magically stimulate our research. No, in this chapter, even though we greatly value the literature, we will approach it strategically and review just enough of it to defend our project and jumpstart its progress.

 

[Literature Review Basics]{.scrivener26}

First, let's make sure you know what you're going to read and where you're going to find it. Your goal is to answer a specific question in a narrow niche of your broader research field. But you can't choose a research question until you have some notion of a topic or at least of a field that you want to work in. You may already have some research ideas, but if not, start your journey by reading some broader material.

You can develop your topic by reading wide. Ask your supervisor for some journals that target broader audiences. Grab a copy of [Science]{.scrivener19}. Find a relevant book. Then cozy up in your favorite coffee shop and wander around these wider publications to start envisioning where you could see yourself doing research. Look for topics that excite you. Identify developing areas in your discipline where new breakthroughs are more likely to occur. Search for problems with broad, rather than narrow application. This is not yet literature review, where you actively take notes and look for specific pieces of information in niche academic journals. This is just reading. Enjoy it, get lost in it, and narrow your way toward a research field that you'd like to contribute to.

Of course, your project might already be funded by a specific research grant. That's great, too. It might not feel as exciting as unfettered reading, but it helps when a research direction is simply provided---especially when you're just starting out. But that funding need not totally constrain you: if you understand the funding source, you may find plenty of latitude in developing a research question that aligns with the funding's intentions. Ask your supervisor for a copy of the funding proposal. Read through it. Get a sense of the research field. Learn some of your supervisor's motivations and research topics so you can develop research questions that they'll be excited to support.

 

![ ](./media/images/00004.jpeg){.calibre6}

 

Now, with a narrower topic, you're ready for deeper reading. First, let's discuss how to download a journal article: I didn't know how when I started and you might not either. Grab a citation from your supervisor's CV for an article in your topic area. Go to your university library's website and search for the article's title and the lead author's name. Click the link, find another link to where the article is available online, enter your login credentials, and download that pdf.

If you're having trouble, head to the library and get help from a real live librarian. While you're there, thank them---they do a lot of behind the scenes work that is rarely noticed. And thank the broader university library system for subscribing to all these academic journals so you don't have to pay \$35 to read each article. Don't write a note to the library administration or anything. Just offer some tribute to the library spirits and be glad that you have free, easy access to the literature---not everyone does.

Of course, you'll want to read more than just one article from your supervisor's CV: you'll look through scores of articles before the literature review is done. But how to find these articles? Here are four ways to build your reading queue:

-   Browse an article's references.[ Start with one of your supervisor's publications, flip to the references at the end, and see what articles they cite there.]{.scrivener30}
-   See who's citing an article.[ Browse articles that reference a publication that you've found particularly insightful. Search for that publication on Google Scholar.]{.scrivener30}[]{#part0010.html_fn27}[[27]{.scrivener33}](#part0026.html#fn27)[ Under the publication's title, click the link "cited by ###" for a list of articles that cite it.]{.scrivener30}
-   Find a review.[ The literature contains some special articles called "reviews" that synthesize the existing literature for a niche topic. Good review articles are goldmines. Search Google Scholar for "review" + key words for your topic. Any articles with "review" in the title should be what you're looking for.]{.scrivener30}
-   Search key words.[ A hit-or-miss tactic, search Google Scholar for key words. You can find key words in the articles you've already gathered. Many articles have actual lists of key words after the abstract---if not, harvest some key words from the articles' titles. Use Booleans---ANDs, ORs, NOTs---in your search and cross your fingers.]{.scrivener30}

Browse every title. Read the abstract for any titles that look relevant. If the abstract seems interesting, download the article, rename it to include the author and title, and save it to your reading queue. You'll continue building your queue throughout the literature review process, but once you've gathered about twenty articles, you're ready to start reading.

 

[Don\'t Read; Skim]{.scrivener26}

The first time I read a research article was disappointing. I expected to be captivated, but I nearly fell asleep. Much of the literature is, sadly, quite boring to read. Though many researchers have exciting science to share, they bury that excitement with lackluster writing.

Luckily, by changing our reading mindset, we can avoid that boring writing without overlooking the exciting science buried underneath. This new mindset lowers our reading expectations to anticipate boring writing. In response, we stop reading and start skimming.

That's right---we won't fully read most articles---at least not from start to finish. Instead, we will use our new, more critical mindset to filter the literature. We filter our reading queue: we ignore most of the publications that we browse because they stray too far from our research topic. We also filter our actual reading: when we find a publication relevant to our topic, we skim its writing for useful information.

The exception to this skimming is when we read "exemplary articles." Exemplary articles speak closely to our research topic. They identify research gaps, detail useful experimental methods, or provide results that we'll compare our findings against. They are publications worth imitating; we will cite them often, so we'll make the effort to read them thoroughly.

Regardless of whether we're reading an exemplary article or skimming a publication for background material, we are fortunate that most articles follow a similar structure. Understanding that structure will greatly improve both our skimming and reading success.

 

[Typical Article Structure]{.scrivener26}

Your main goal during literature review is to skim. Practically, this means distilling hundreds of pages of reading into a handful of well-organized notes. To do this, you will create two sets of notes. The first set summarizes each article individually by trimming its thousands of words down to a few pithy sentences. The second set synthesizes these summaries to help identify research gaps and develop your research question.

But before you create these notes, let's first define the typical journal article structure---the structure that streamlines the skimming and note-taking process. Disciplines and journals vary slightly, but most science and engineering publications share a common writing structure: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion. Also known as IMRaD,[]{#part0010.html_fn28}[[28]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn28) this structure progresses through the following sections:

-   Abstract:[ what does the article cover? The abstract precedes the main text. It summarizes the Introduction, Methods, Results & Discussion in one brief paragraph.]{.scrivener30}
-   Introduction:[ why does this research matter? Good articles answer that question in two scopes. First, they give broad motivation, explaining how the research addresses larger scientific questions or societal problems. Second, they give scientific justification, describing a research gap in their field and how the research fills it. This second scope may be written as a separate "Background" or "Literature Review" section.]{.scrivener30}
-   Methods:[ how was this research accomplished? This section explains the theory, experimental design, apparatus, calculations, and statistical analysis used to generate the experimental data.]{.scrivener30}
-   Results:[ what do the experimental data show? This section synthesizes the experimental output into figures, tables, and statistics. It points out trends, relationships, outliers, or observations that fuel the discussion.]{.scrivener30}
-   Discussion:[ what can we infer from our findings? This section draws meaning from the Results to answer the research question. It places that meaning in the context of other academic work to widen the meaning to the larger research field. "Results & Discussion" may comprise a single section, in which case the facts will intermingle with the author's interpretations of the facts---it's important to distinguish fact from interpretation.]{.scrivener30}
-   Conclusion:[ what does this article claim? The Conclusion ends the article by refocusing on the main point. It reminds the reader of the research question, the main finding that answers that research question, and how that answer connects to the Introduction's motivations. The Conclusion might have its own section header, or it might be an unadorned paragraph at the end of the Results & Discussion section. Regardless, it will be near the end of the publication.]{.scrivener30}

That's the order you'll see many publications written in, but it's not the order you should read them in. Given your new-found skepticism about an article being relevant or well-written, your default tactic involves skimming only as much as needed to fill your notes. Reading an entire article from start to finish is an inefficient way to accomplish that. Rather, you'll want to skip around the article's various sections hunting for specific information. Let's discuss a note-taking strategy to help you do that.

 

[Take Useful Notes]{.scrivener26}

Use the following note-taking strategy to guide your reading for each article. See the appendix for a note-taking template. Or to create your own, list the article's title, journal, and publication year at the top of your notes. Add the following sections: Research Question, Motivation, Results, Methods, Impressions. Then start skimming the article:

-   1\. Start with the Introduction.[ Look for the motivation and research question. The motivation is often near the first paragraph. It describes why the research is valuable. The research question is often near the last paragraph. It describes the specific goals of the research study. Write a one-sentence summary of each in your notes.]{.scrivener30}
-   2\. Skip ahead to the Results & Discussion.[ Look for the main finding, which directly answers the research question, and a few supplementary findings, which provide context and caveats to the main finding. A good article organizes its findings via subsection headers and figures. You can often use those signposts to quickly discern the results. If those aren't forthcoming, you might need to dig into the text a bit more. Many studies provide an overabundance of results. Keep the research question in mind and filter out the findings that answer it. Write a one-sentence summary of the main finding and each supplementary finding. Paste helpful figures to your notes. Synthesize the article's Discussion into a few sentences about how its results fit in with the broader field.]{.scrivener30}
-   3\. Flip back to the Methods.[ Good articles will start their Methods with a few introductory paragraphs that broadly summarize the experiment's different stages, how they interact, and what data they generate. That's the paragraph you want to put in your notes. If the author doesn't provide it, you'll have to write it yourself. Most publications will at least have subsection headers to guide you, but every article will require some skimming to ensure that you understand the experiment. When you're starting out, it's tough to skim the Methods section because all research methods are new and complicated.]{.scrivener30}[]{#part0010.html_fn29}[[29]{.scrivener33}](#part0026.html#fn29)[ Eventually you'll recognize similar methods and skimming them becomes easier; many methods simply vary on a similar theme. Read enough to write a paragraph about the method's stages, their interactions, and the output data.]{.scrivener30}
-   4\. Read the Conclusion.[ The author should synthesize the article's main points here. An above-average manuscript will signal the Conclusion with a section header or a paragraph that starts with "In conclusion," but all articles---even if they don't explicitly identify a Conclusion---should have some sort of wrap-up summary near the end. Reading the Conclusion helps you verify that you understood the article. If you did a good job skimming, there should be no surprises here.]{.scrivener30}

 

![ ](./media/images/00004.jpeg){.calibre6}

 

We started the chapter by identifying five things the literature gives our project: motivation, background, comparative results, methods justification, and research gaps. So far, the note-taking template addresses the first four, but we still need to explore the research gap. We cannot identify a gap by reading a single publication: we must look across multiple articles. We can still ponder each article individually, though, and collect ongoing observations that will help us eventually identify a research gap.

This pondering happens in the last section of your notes: Impressions. Most of your notes are just summaries, but here you must stop and ask some critical questions about what you've just read. Go to the Impressions section of your notes and consider the following:

-   How would you adjust the article's research question to better fit its motivation and research gap? What other aspects of the motivation and research gap are not being addressed by the research question?
-   What findings would you add to better answer the article's research question? What limitations does the author identify about the Results? What seems strange about the data shown in the article's figures?
-   In the Discussion, how do the findings vary from other studies? Do you agree with the authors' explanation of those differences? If not, what extra information would better explain those differences?
-   What questions do you have about the experimental method? What part of the method seems underdeveloped? How could parts of the method be improved?
-   What assumptions do the authors make? Do you agree with those assumptions? Should the experiment be expanded to abandon those assumptions?

Answering these questions might be challenging. Keep trying. As you read and interact with the literature, some questions, omissions, and gaps will continue to stand out. You'll identify these recurring weaknesses later when you use your notes' Impressions to synthesize your ponderings across multiple articles and explore the research gap.

After this depth of skimming, you're usually done. But occasionally you'll find an exemplary study that relates strongly to your research topic. These publications merit greater attention. Read them again, from beginning to end, and lengthen your notes. Over time, you'll reread these exemplary articles more than once, so don't burden your notes by summarizing their content fully. You just need enough detail to jog your memory and capture their most significant takeaways.

 

[Explore the Research Gap]{.scrivener26}

This note-taking strategy will help you read individual articles and produce notes for each unique publication. But you must read forty, fifty, or more articles during your literature review. And you must synthesize themes across all of them to identify your project's research gap.

You will accomplish this by keeping a second set of notes---a "literature synopsis." The literature synopsis simply compiles the high points of your individual article notes. It has two sections. In the first section, paste the one-sentence research question and one-sentence method from each article that you review. In the second section, paste your notes' Impressions. Each time you take notes on an article, paste those two items into the literature synopsis. See the appendix for a literature synopsis template.

Eventually, that synopsis grows into a ledger that critiques your overall literature review. Your reading Impressions lack meaning in isolation, but when you synthesize them, you'll begin to notice limitations, criticisms, and weaknesses that span multiple journal articles.

Those weaknesses stand out when you review your literature synopsis periodically. Initially, your Impressions will include many unanswered questions. But continued reading will absolve many of these questions---either because you gain some foundational knowledge or because you find publications that answer them. But as you keep reading, a few of those questions will linger. And the more you read, the surer you'll become that these remaining questions haven't yet been answered.

Those lingering questions bound your research gap. You can combine them and rewrite them in ways that identify an unexplored niche in your research field. And with that, you've discovered a viable research gap that you can use to create your research question, and you've conducted the literature review to support it.

 

[A Weekly Rhythm]{.scrivener26}

The hardest part about reviewing the literature is its vastness. Its sheer volume discourages me in three ways. First, I doubt: I see all of these publications and wonder if I can really contribute something new. Second, I procrastinate: with scores of articles to read, skipping one reading day won't impact my timeline. Third, I dread: I see an overwhelming mountain of reading and cannot motivate myself to begin.

We must overcome these hurdles. The last part of our strategic literature review method describes a weekly rhythm that keeps this whole process manageable. This weekly routine has two features. First, it must help us pace ourselves. Literature review is relatively straightforward, but reading poorly-written article after poorly-written article is exhausting; it can take a lot of concentration to decipher the intentions of an inarticulate author. Reading more than two or three publications a day becomes unmanageable. Second, our weekly rhythm must let us periodically review our literature synopsis.

With that in mind, your weekly literature review routine should look something like this:

-   1.[ Each day, review the literature during your scheduled deep work time. Aim to skim two publications and take notes using the strategies in this chapter.]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ Augment that with a planning session at the end of each week. During that session, browse your reading queue, keep any articles worth skimming, and delete the rest. You'll also review your literature synopsis: reread your critiques and questions, delete any that you've answered, and consolidate the rest by common themes. Finally, pick ten articles to review for the next week.]{.scrivener30}

 

[When to Move On]{.scrivener26}

The beauty of this literature review process is that you get to pat yourself on the back each day for getting a bit done. You need not break new ground or find your research gap. But if you take notes on two articles, consider it a good day's work.

The problem with this process is it lacks a clear stopping point. You can endlessly find more articles, note them, curate your literature synopsis, and never finish.[]{#part0010.html_fn30}[[30]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn30) Let's solve that problem by defining some criteria that tell you when to stop.

You're done with the literature review phase when:

-   1.[ All of the questions in your literature synopsis have been answered, deleted, or confirmed as identifying a research gap. Hopefully you have a handful of these unanswered questions so you can start forming a research gap around the most promising ones.]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ You've identified some experimental methods for exploring your research gap. Your literature review yields some example experiments. You can use those experimental methods verbatim or add minor adjustments. Beware the temptation to create new methods: experiments rarely run smoothly, and it's difficult enough to publish something without inventing a new method along the way. ]{.scrivener30}[]{#part0010.html_fn31}[[31]{.scrivener33}](#part0026.html#fn31)[Save those new method ideas for future projects, when you have more experience to handle the extra risk.]{.scrivener30}
-   3.[ You've found a handful of exemplary articles. These publications give your work a foundation to build on. They support your project's reasonableness and feasibility. You'll want to find a few of them, at least.]{.scrivener30}

Continue your weekly rhythm until you meet those criteria. In the meantime, get feedback from your supervisor. Though your supervisor cannot offer immediate assistance, I assume you have regular access to their guidance---for example, a standing monthly meeting. If you lack that guidance, identify a relatively experienced researcher---a research associate, postdoc, or senior graduate student---who can offer regular guidance and schedule a standing meeting with them instead. Then come to your supervisor meetings prepared: bring questions, confusions, and talking points.

The literature synopsis, in particular, provides helpful talking points for your supervisor meetings. These talking points help you approach your supervisor to discuss research motivations for your field, methods you have questions about, and research gaps you are noticing. And your supervisor can help validate that your stopping criteria are satisfied.

 

![ ](./media/images/00004.jpeg){.calibre6}

 

Wrapping up the literature review concludes the first phase of your research project. Your notes will help you write and experiment by motivating your work, providing background information, comparing your findings to other articles, defending your methods, and identifying a research gap. Those benefits will become more apparent in the next chapter, where you'll develop a research question, outline your project, and detail its experimental methods.

 

[Chapter Recap]{.scrivener26}

Literature review provides a foundation for our project. It eases the writing and the experimenting phases of the research process. We identified five practical uses for our literature review:

-   1.[ to motivate our work and explain its social value,]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ to provide technical background information,]{.scrivener30}
-   3[. to compare our findings against other articles',]{.scrivener30}
-   4[. to communicate our project's scientific novelty by framing the research gap, and]{.scrivener30}
-   5.[ to justify our experimental methods.]{.scrivener30}

To efficiently realize these benefits, we developed a strategic literature review method which prioritizes filtering and skimming research publications to efficiently populate our note-taking template. Each day, we skim two journal articles and take individual notes. Those notes include information about each article's research question, motivation, results, methods, and our Impressions. As we read articles, we compile our Impressions into a broader literature synopsis. Each week, we augment our daily reviews with a planning session to curate our reading queue and update our literature synopsis.

We discussed the following criteria for deciding when to move on from the literature review phase:

-   1.[ All of our literature synopsis questions have been answered, deleted, or confirmed as identifying a research gap,]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ we've identified some experimental methods for exploring that research gap, and]{.scrivener30}
-   3.[ we've found some exemplary articles.]{.scrivener30}

[Outline the Project]{.scrivener15}

 

Let's start this chapter with a horror story. It's my last semester of undergrad and I'm nearing finals week. I'm tense with the stress and anticipation that follows months of working on my senior project; the report still lacks some editing, but I'm excited to be done with it. I open my computer to make a few adjustments, but the report isn't there. My hard drive is empty. I gulp. I can't remember the last time I backed up my computer. I had so many opportunities to do so, but I foolishly pushed it off. And now I'll have to write the whole report from scratch.

Okay, that didn't actually happen. At least, not to me. But the story captures my sense of horror and foolishness resulting from a similar situation: failing to outline my research project before experimenting.

After completing my first literature review, I certainly felt more focused than when I had wandered aimlessly through experimentation. But instead of stopping to summarize my literature notes, I took that reassurance and jumped right back into the lab.

The longer I experimented, the less I remembered from my literature review. The results and assumptions of different articles mixed together. Various methods jumbled around in my head. And much of what I read I simply forgot. The outcome was a lot of re-reading and backstepping as I repeatedly corrected mistakes in my experimental method. And when the experiment ended, and I began to write the article, I so misremembered my citations that I practically had to redo the literature review anew. How foolish to leave that vital information to memory.

Writing an outline relieves our memory of that burden; it's like backing up our research project. Unless we outline our literature review now, we will lose much of that hard work to our poor long-term memory.[]{#part0011.html_fn32}[[32]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn32)

Outlines, moreover, focus our jumbled thoughts into something more coherent; the outline-creation process refines, organizes, and details our project before it even begins. And when we craft our outline around our research question, it keeps our work motivated in the right direction.

 

![ ](./media/images/00004.jpeg){.calibre6}

 

In the outline developed in this chapter, we'll sort our literature review notes into the appropriate sections of our journal article, combine those notes into broader syntheses, develop our research question, and detail our experimental methods. At the end, we'll have a wordy but organized project outline that resembles an early draft of our journal article. We'll use that outline to guide our experiment in the next chapter and to jumpstart our writing two chapters after that. It might feel like one more hurdle keeping us from our experiment, but a good outline will save us from the foolishness of poorly planned methods and the horror of writing a journal article from scratch.

 

[Benefits of Outlining]{.scrivener26}

Remember the goals of literature review: to motivate our research, provide background information for our readers, find comparisons for our results, defend our methods, and most importantly, to define our research gap. Those are useful goals that ease our writing and experimenting. But the loosely organized pile of literature review notes from the previous chapter can't quite achieve all of that. No, to realize those benefits, we must transform those literature review notes into a comprehensive project outline. But how does that help us?

For one, it captures our undocumented literature review perspectives before we lose them. There is a lot floating around in our head right now. We've taken good notes, but we have many unwritten thoughts that need to migrate from our brain onto paper. Outlining helps us capture those thoughts before they disappear. It helps us solidify our broad impression of the literature before we spend months experimenting and forget half of what we've read.

Outlining also organizes our research project.[]{#part0011.html_fn33}[[33]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn33) Literature review provides a useful foundation, but our disorganized, loosely-connected notes hardly substitute for a systematic research plan. Consider how we would describe the current project to a friend. We could generally describe the research gap---that's a good start. But could we explain the finer details? How will we fill that gap? What data will our experiment generate? What methods will produce that data? We have only vague answers to these questions, and we cannot adequately elaborate them until we synthesize our reading into something more organized. So at the very least, we should outline our project to spare friends from our droning monologue about our underdeveloped experiment.[ ]{.scrivener27}[]{#part0011.html_fn34}[[34]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn34) Even our mothers don't have the patience to suffer through such ramblings---they'll listen, of course, but they're only being nice.

Outlining also scrutinizes our experimental methods. Inadequate planning can severely frustrate our experiment. Experiments require significant effort; we cannot easily repeat them after discovering an error in our methods. A detailed experiment plan saves us from that drudgery and increases our chance of success.

Outlining greatly benefits our project. But like all phases of the research process, it can be a frustrating task unless we approach it methodically. In the next pages, we'll avoid that frustration by working through a step-by-step outlining plan.

 

[Refine the Literature Review]{.scrivener26}

Your goal for this chapter is to create a project outline---a document that resembles a journal article in structure, sorts your literature review into the appropriate article sections, and synthesizes your literature review into early versions of your motivation, research gap, and experimental method. The outline will evolve as your project progresses, but you'll make a complete draft of it now to get you headed in the right direction. See the appendix for a project outline template.

Begin your outline by creating an empty IMRaD structure that you will methodically populate. Remember from the previous chapter that a typical journal article follows the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion structure. Use the literature to verify your field's unique IMRaD conventions. Then, start your outline by adding your field's particular IMRaD section headers to a blank document with some space in between sections for writing.

 

[Sort the Literature]{.scrivener5}

Next, you'll organize your literature review notes by sorting information into the appropriate IMRaD sections and synthesizing some broader takeaways. At first, this involves a lot of copying and pasting. Maintain a filtering mindset---you won't paste notes from every article you've read---although it's better to be generous at this stage and remove superfluous material later on.

Get all of your individual article notes in one place so you can easily flip through them. Open your notes for every study and paste any useful content---along with a citation---into the following sections:

-   1.[ In the Introduction, create a subsection header that reads, "What is the broad question being asked in my field?" For each article in your notes, copy the one-sentence research question and add a citation. You'll end up with a list of dozens of two-sentence summaries about what researchers in your field are working on.]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ Also in the Introduction, create a subsection header that reads, "Why is that question important?" For each article in your notes, copy the one-sentence research motivation. You'll end up with a list of one-sentence motivations that are driving the research in your field.]{.scrivener30}
-   3.[ In the Results, create a subsection header that reads, "What main findings does the literature show to answer my field's research questions?" For each article in your notes, copy the one-sentence main finding. For exemplary articles---publications with particular relevance to your project---also add supplementary findings along with data, tables, and figures if helpful. You'll end up with a list of the main findings in your research field along with the niche results from your closest peers.]{.scrivener30}
-   4.[ In the Methods, create subsections entitled Procedure, Sample, Apparatus, Calculations, Statistics, Data, etc. These subsections are just suggestions---they are neither exhaustive nor required. For each article in your notes, take any methods that you might use in your experiment and sort them under the relevant subsection.]{.scrivener30}

 

[Synthesize the Literature]{.scrivener5}

You must now make sense of all that copying and pasting by doing a bit of synthesis to look for common themes.[]{#part0011.html_fn35}[[35]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn35) Currently, you have little more than a long list of referenced notes. By distilling them into something more cohesive, you can tailor these notes to your particular research project and develop some commentary that you'll use when writing your journal article's First Draft.

Work your way through the different outline subsections and search for common themes. Start, for example, with the Introduction. Under the subsection "What is the broad question being asked in my field?", read through the different research questions. What common ground can you find among these diverse research questions? What broader research questions can you write that capture the spirit of multiple of these referenced journal articles? Write three research questions that cover a majority of the referenced journal articles. Then sort those articles under the new research question that best describes them. Push the leftovers to a separate block of text---you'll likely delete these extras, but let them linger for now in case you need them later.

In the same way, synthesize other subsections of your outline. Look for common themes in the research literature's motivations, background information, methods, and results. Work through the different subsections of the outline, create two or three summarizing categories, sort the applicable referenced notes under the appropriate category, and move the leftovers to a separate block of text.

Although each of these syntheses adds value to the project, the most important subsection describes the research gap. The research gap and research question underpin your whole project. They deserve special attention in this synthesis exercise.

 

[Define the Research Question]{.scrivener5}

At the end of the Introduction, create a subsection entitled, "Research Gap". In this subsection, you'll refine the previous chapter's loosely defined literature synopsis into a concrete research gap and you'll target that gap with a research question.

Your literature synopsis notes contain a raw version of your research gap. You must refine that raw material into a tight, unified statement. Pull out the most interesting notes from the synopsis and rework them into a short paragraph that describes the research gap. That paragraph pinpoints a research topic that the literature currently overlooks. It answers the following questions:

-   What does the literature currently do well?
-   Despite those advances, what knowledge does the literature lack?
-   What is the literature missing that makes it unable to fill that knowledge gap?

An organized way to answer those questions is to choose three significant weaknesses from your literature synopsis and combine them into a research gap. These weaknesses might be experimental limitations, weak assumptions, narrow applications, caveats, omissions, etc. For each of these weaknesses:

-   1.[ Summarize the weakness.]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ Describe the research area, citing a few publications, where that weakness is most prevalent.]{.scrivener30}
-   3.[ Point out how each of those publications exhibits that weakness.]{.scrivener30}

Then, combine those weaknesses into the research gap. How do those weaknesses synergize? By adding all of those weaknesses together, what larger limitation is revealed? That larger limitation is your research gap. It tells the reader what the literature does not know. Describe that research gap in a detailed paragraph. Then place the finished research gap paragraph at the end of the Introduction section.

Writing a clear version of the research gap allows you to now define your research question. Simply put, the research question is an inquiry whose answer will fill the research gap. It must be succinct but still capture the project's breadth. Achieving this requires a bit of effort---revisit Chapter 1 for some pointers.

If you're feeling stuck, use feedback from colleagues to develop your idea. Recruit some peers for a brainstorming session. Present a literature review to your research group. Discuss your ideas with an experienced researcher at a conference. There are numerous ways to reach out to others for feedback, and with an outline to organize your thoughts and reduce your likelihood of rambling, you can feel confident of securing feedback from people other than your mother.

It can also help to brainstorm multiple questions: a main research question with some supplementary questions to add context. When the research question adequately addresses the research gap and captures the theme of the project, place it at the end of the Introduction section directly after your research gap paragraph. Make the research question stand out: highlight it, write it in bold font. It's a lighthouse in the turbulent seas of experimenting and writing. You'll look at it regularly during the research process to reorient yourself and avoid a figurative research shipwreck.

As an example, let's revisit our potions-making friend from Chapter 1. When we last left her, she planned to test whether a vinegar-cat-hair infusion might use trait-reversal to create a productivity potion. Reviewing the literature has helped her formalize this concept and expand its scope into something more scientifically novel.

In her literature review, our friend identified two weaknesses. First, the fur-infusion potions-making field has failed to create a productivity potion. Fur-infusion potions have successfully captured many desirable animal traits---improved memory from elephants, for example. Productivity, however, has been a difficult trait to capture: in two unsuccessful attempts, for example, researchers captured the beaver's hunger for wood and the draft-horse's desire to graze but failed to capture either animal's productivity trait.

Second, the trait-reversal field---whereby a sour solvent reverses the effect of a sweet-solvent-based potion---is largely unexplored. Our friend found only a handful of successful trait-reversal studies, primarily from the plant-based potions-making field. She discovered only one trait-reversal study in her fur-infusions field---a vinegar-pig-hair infusion that suppressed hunger.

Given these weaknesses, our potions-making friend identified a research gap: the literature knows nothing about whether a trait-reversal fur-infusion could produce a successful productivity potion. In fact, the literature knows little about trait-reversal potions in general, and almost nothing about trait-reversal via fur-infusions.

Given that gap, our friend's research question asks whether a trait-reversal fur-infusion can create a productivity potion. Or, more generally, her project asks whether trait-reversal can be achieved by fur-infusion potions at all.

This research question broadens the scope of her initial idea---to test vinegar-cat-hair infusions. She now realizes, given the lack of research data, that testing multiple hairs and solvents will make her project more scientifically novel. In addition to vinegar, she will use a solvent successfully used in plant-based trait-reversal potions---lemon juice. In addition to cat hair, she will use another hair successfully used in laziness-inducing potions---hair from opossums: notoriously lazy animals that sleep 20-hours per day---as well as a hair untested by the literature---sloth hair, which she can procure from a nearby zoo. This added breadth will increase her chance of developing a productivity potion and contribute more data to the trait-reversal potions-making field.

 

[Weave Your Project Into the Literature]{.scrivener26}

With some syntheses, a research gap, and a research question to work from, you can begin weaving the literature with the specific details of your own project. Work your way back through the outline and answer some specific questions about how your motivations, research question, anticipated findings, and methods interact with the literature.

Remember from Chapter 1 that a well-crafted project fills a gap in the scientific knowledge and improves society. Start by weaving your research question into the literature to support those two motivations:

-   1.[ At the end of the Introduction, after your research question, write the question "How does my research question fill the research gap?" The answer might seem obvious but remember that your readers will see the connection less clearly. You must make that connection clear for them. Sift through each aspect of the research gap and explain how the answer to your research question will address it.]{.scrivener30}
-   2.[ At the end of the Introduction subsection entitled "Why is that question important?" write the question, "How does my research project improve society?" You've identified a research gap and proposed a research question that will fill it. Now consider how society might improve when you answer it. You can draw heavily from your research field's motivations. It's perfectly fine to share your peers' motivations. But it's nice to have your own little twist if possible. What niche research topics might your project open up? What interdisciplinary connections would it forge? How might it impact technology or policy? Aim for enthusiasm without being grandiose: a good article---especially your first publication---need not revolutionize the world.]{.scrivener30}

Now pause and consider your progress. You've done a lot of reading, summarizing, and synthesis to arrive at a well-motivated, well-defined research gap and a research question whose answer will fill that gap. Many experiment-motivated researchers labor through years of dead-end side projects to arrive at the same milestone. So display your research question somewhere prominent---maybe not on a tattoo or anything, at least not until the article is published---but cherish that research question. It represents your deepening pool of background knowledge in one succinct sentence. It's a motivational guidepost for your project, and it means you're headed in the right direction.

To conclude the outline, you will continue weaving your project into the literature by elaborating your Results and Methods. This last step is all about planning your experiment. You're about to jump into the weeds---the technical details that you've been salivating over since you accepted your grad school appointment. This last push takes some effort, but it will complete the outline and set you up to conduct a successful experiment in the next chapter.

 

[Plan the Experiment]{.scrivener26}

The last part of the outlining phase defines the methods you'll use in your experiment. You want a lot of detail about each step of the experiment plan. A detailed plan helps identify errors, missing equipment, incomplete calculations, or other hurdles. By identifying these hurdles now, before the actual experiment, you limit your mistakes and avoid wandering down unproductive research rabbit trails.

 

[Begin with the Data in Mind]{.scrivener5}

Experiments produce data.[]{#part0011.html_fn36}[[36]{.scrivener27}](#part0026.html#fn36) Although generating data isn't your project's ultimate goal, you'll use data to produce findings that will answer your research question, which fills your research gap to advance science and improve society. But it all begins with your experiment's output data. So before you elaborate your experimental methods, you will brainstorm some anticipated findings, decide what data you will need to generate those findings, and then build your experiment with that output data in mind.

Go to your outline's Results section and hypothesize some findings for your experiment. Take cues from results in the literature. Brainstorm with your supervisor and other colleagues. Work out an answer to the question, "What experimental findings will answer my research question?" If it helps, you can break that question down into smaller components:

-   What cause/effect relationships do you anticipate?
-   What experimental variables might be important for showing those relationships?
-   Are those variables dependent or independent?
-   What other relationships, correlations, trends, distributions, comparisons, or compositions of those variables would you like to explore?
-   What is the main finding---that directly answers the research question?
-   What are the supplementary findings---that add context or give caveats to the main finding?

It's helpful to conceptualize your answers to these questions by writing about them, sharing your ideas with a colleague, and then drawing some draft figures. Make these figures clear: label the axes, plot the hypothetical data, note the relationships you hypothesize the data will show. Make as many of these figures as you want---this is brainstorming and there are no bad ideas.

Eventually, settle on a main finding that directly answers the research question, some supplementary findings that add context to that answer, and one or two figures for each of those findings. Then ask yourself what data you'll need to create those figures. Be specific. Include units. Make spreadsheets with column headers to hold your non-existent data. And now, with your output data in mind, let's design an experiment to create it.
